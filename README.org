* Overview

org-mcp is an Emacs package that implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Org-mode. It enables AI assistants and other MCP clients to interact with your Org files through a structured API.

* Installation

On Emacs 29.1 or later:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package-vc-install "https://github.com/laurynas-biveinis/org-mcp.git")
#+end_src

Or with =use-package= and =:vc= (Emacs 30+):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-mcp
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/laurynas-biveinis/org-mcp.git")
  :custom
  (org-mcp-allowed-files '("/path/to/foo.org" "/path/to/bar.org"))
  (org-mcp-read-only t))
#+end_src

Eventually I plan to publish this package on MELPA.

* Usage

**WARNING:** some of the tools in this package give LLMs WRITE access to your Org
files, and, once in a thousand invocations, LLMs *will* try to delete everything,
because they are like that. Backups and automatic versioning on every change are
strongly advised.

** Configuring allowed files

Once you read and internalized the warning above, set the allowed Org file set, using
absolute paths:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-mcp-allowed-files '("/path/to/foo.org" "/path/to/bar.org"))
#+end_src

** Read-only mode

To disable all write operations, set =org-mcp-read-only= to =t=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-mcp-read-only t)
#+end_src

When enabled, the four write tools (=org-update-todo-state=, =org-add-todo=,
=org-rename-headline=, =org-edit-body=) will return an error. Read tools remain
available.

** Registering with an MCP Client

After =mcp-server-lib= has been properly installed (including =M-x mcp-server-lib-install=), register =org-mcp= with your MCP client:

#+begin_src bash
claude mcp add -s user -t stdio org-mcp -- ~/.emacs.d/emacs-mcp-stdio.sh --server-id=org-mcp --init-function=org-mcp-enable --stop-function=org-mcp-disable
#+end_src

Before using the MCP server, you must start it in Emacs with =M-x mcp-server-lib-start=. Stop it with =M-x mcp-server-lib-stop= when done.

** Available MCP Resources

*Note:* File paths in URIs use minimal encoding (only =#= characters are encoded). Avoid using =%= characters in Org file names.

*** org://{filename}
- *Description:* Access the raw content of an allowed Org file
- *URI Pattern:* =org://{filename}= where filename is the absolute path to the file
- *Configuration:* Files must be explicitly allowed via =org-mcp-allowed-files= using absolute paths
- *Returns:* Plain text content of the Org file

*** org-outline://{filename}
- *Description:* Get the hierarchical structure of an Org file
- *URI Pattern:* =org-outline://{filename}= where filename is the absolute path to the file
- *Configuration:* Files must be explicitly allowed via =org-mcp-allowed-files= using absolute paths
- *Returns:* JSON representation of the document structure with headings and their levels

Example — access via MCP:

=URI: org-outline:///home/user/org/projects.org=

Returns JSON structure like:
#+begin_src json
{
  "headings": [
    {
      "title": "Project Alpha",
      "level": 1,
      "children": [
        {"title": "Requirements", "level": 2, "children": []},
        {"title": "Implementation", "level": 2, "children": []}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
#+end_src

*** org-headline://{filename}#{path}
- *Description:* Access the content of a specific headline by its path
- *URI Pattern:* =org-headline://{filename}#{path}= where:
  - =filename= is the absolute path (with # encoded as %23)
  - =path= is URL-encoded headline titles separated by =/=
  - Headlines containing # must be encoded as %23 in the path
- *Configuration:* Files must be explicitly allowed via =org-mcp-allowed-files= using absolute paths
- *Returns:* Plain text content of the specified headline section including all subheadings

Example:
#+begin_example
# Access a headline:
URI: org-headline:///home/user/org/projects.org#Project%20Alpha/Requirements
Returns: Content of "Requirements" under "Project Alpha"

# Headline with # character (must be encoded as %23):
URI: org-headline:///home/user/org/projects.org#Issue%20%2342
Returns: Content of "Issue #42" headline

# Access entire file (no fragment):
URI: org-headline:///home/user/org/projects.org
Returns: Full content of the file

# File with # in the name (must be encoded as %23):
URI: org-headline:///home/user/org/file%231.org#Headline
Returns: Content of "Headline" from file#1.org

# Both file and headline with # (all encoded):
URI: org-headline:///home/user/org/file%231.org#Task%20%235
Returns: Content of "Task #5" from file#1.org
#+end_example

*Encoding limitations:* File paths use minimal encoding (only =#= → =%23=) for readability.
Files with =%= characters in their names should be avoided, as they may cause decoding issues.
For such files, rename them or use =org-id://= URIs instead. Headline paths use full URL
encoding.

*** org-id URI Format
- *Description:* Access Org node content by its unique ID property
- *URI Pattern:* =org-id://{uuid}= where uuid is the value of an ID property
- *Configuration:* The file containing the ID must be in =org-mcp-allowed-files=
- *Returns:* Plain text content of the headline with the specified ID, including all subheadings

Example:
#+begin_example
# Org file with ID property:
,* Project Meeting Notes
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
:END:
Meeting content here...
#+end_example

Access via MCP:
- URI: =org-id://550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000=
- Returns: Content of "Project Meeting Notes" section

** Available MCP Tools

Note: All write tools will create Org IDs for any touched nodes that did not have
them originally. The IDs will be returned in the tool response.

  "new_body": "Initial task description."
}
#+end_src

** Workaround Tools Duplicating Resource Templates

*Note:* The following tools are temporary workarounds that duplicate the resource template functionality as tools. They exist because Claude Code currently doesn't discover resource templates.

*** org-read-file
- *Description:* Read complete raw content of an Org file
- *Parameters:*
  - =file= (string, required): Absolute path to an Org file
- *Returns:* Plain text content of the entire Org file
- *Configuration:* File must be in =org-mcp-allowed-files=

*** org-read-outline
- *Description:* Get hierarchical structure of an Org file as JSON outline
- *Parameters:*
  - =file= (string, required): Absolute path to an Org file
- *Returns:* JSON object with hierarchical outline structure
- *Configuration:* File must be in =org-mcp-allowed-files=

*** org-read-headline
- *Description:* Read specific Org headline by hierarchical path
- *Parameters:*
  - =file= (string, required): Absolute path to an Org file
  - =headline_path= (string, required): Non-empty slash-separated path to headline. Only slashes within headline titles must be URL-encoded as =%2F= to distinguish them from path separators. Other characters (spaces, =#=, etc.) do not need encoding. To read entire files, use =org-read-file= instead
- *Returns:* Plain text content of the headline and its subtree
- *Configuration:* File must be in =org-mcp-allowed-files=

*** org-read-by-id
- *Description:* Read Org headline by its unique ID property
- *Parameters:*
  - =uuid= (string, required): UUID from headline's ID property
- *Returns:* Plain text content of the headline and its subtree
- *Configuration:* File containing the ID must be in =org-mcp-allowed-files=
- *Note:* More stable than path-based access since IDs don't change when headlines are renamed or moved
